## Software Control
The ATEM Software Control provides a comprehensive interface to control and monitor your ATEM Mini Pro. It allows you to access advanced settings, customize macros, and manage your live production workflow. You can download the ATEM Software Control from the [Blackmagic Design website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com).

A note to mention is that the software is not required to record and stream, this is just a visual interface for the ATEM to better change settings.
